## Our Responsibilities as<br />(Open Source) Developers



## In the beginning there was a tweet



<div class="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/nke_ise/status/1271030438455324672" data-size="0.9"></div>



<blockquote>
    &ldquo;I disagree. We, the community, are not a political party - we should not be declaring solidarity 
    with this or that movement for this or that end goal. 
    And more importantly we certainly should not be declaring *unconditional* solidarity 
    with any political movements.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

Notes: Negative feedback



<blockquote>
    &ldquo;We don‚Äôt need to declare solidarity with a movement but we should raise 
    our voices against discrimination and racism. 
    Both are not political issues, they are human and ethical issues.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

Notes: Positive feedback, but true?



<blockquote>
    &ldquo;Racism is not about politics!
       #blm is not a political movement.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

Notes: Positive feedback, but isn't racism or anti racism political?



```php
function isPolitical(Entity $entity): bool
{
    return $entity instanceof Politics
}

var_dump(isPolitical($openSourceDevelopment));
```

Output: false

Really? I think that is a bug.

Notes: There are a million things to note or explain here, but I'm only trying to make a single point

Notes: Bias and Privilege cause and contribute to inequality

{
    return $entity instanceof Politics

var_dump(isPolitical($openSourceDevelopment));
```



## What is politics?


<blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+politics">
    &ldquo;The activities associated with the governance of a country or area,
   especially the debate between parties having power.&rdquo;

<blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+politics">
    &ldquo;Activities aimed at improving someone's status or increasing
   power within an organization.&rdquo;

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">
    &ldquo;Politics is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, 
    or other forms of power relations between individuals,
    such as the distribution of resources or status.&rdquo;

Even private behaviour and action,<br />
re-enforces a status quo of inequality

Notes: Our bias and privilege, creates and repeats inequality



If we only hang around with people like ourselves,
we only decide for what is good for us.



If we only hang around with people like ourselves,
we establish ourselves as norm.



If we only hang around with people like ourselves,
we tend to ignore other peoples struggles and needs.



```php
function isPolitical(Entity $entity): bool
{
    return $entity instanceof Politics
}

var_dump(isPolitical($openSourceDevelopment));
```

Output: true



So what can we do about it?



### Take on responsibility

- educate ourselves
- expand our bubble
- learn from others
- listen to others
- give people a voice who don't usually have one



<div class="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/bbcbitesize/status/1280522349733982209" data-size="1"></div>



## Our responsibilities as OpenSource developers

- Developing things right 
- Developing the right thing 



We can't build the right thing if we're ignoring other peoples needs or struggles



## It's our responsibility to be

- anti-ableist 
- anti-fascist 
- anti-racist
- anti-sexist 



It is our responsibility not because it makes us a "better person",
but because it is our **JOB** to *build the right thing*.
