## Some tips to become and stay happy with OSS



## Users


## Treat Downloads as a gift

- There is never too much "Thank you"
- Consider making gifts yourself


## Think about OSS as an investment  


## You can download and use it for free, but you get more out of it if you invest some time

- Report back errors or different expectations
- Help writing and / or improving documentation
- Help others with their errors and different expectations
- Make suggestions for improvements


## If you help to improve the software you use, you also help your future self


## More tips

- Be nice and respectful in communication
- Be graceful with developer's mistakes (bugs)
- Prefer public channels for communication
- Ask questions, but don't forget to say thank you for receiving an answer
- Respect the time of others, by communicating brief and precise
- Be patient



## Developers


## Users are not your enemy

- Write better software and tutorials before suggesting to "RTFM"
- Be graceful with users's mistakes
- Listen carefully to feedback
- Learn to distinguish between laziness of a user and your laziness to build better software


## Underestimated areas for improvements

- Onboarding experience for other coders
- Documentation
- Diverse perspectives of the problem domain


## More tips

- Be nice and respectful in communication
- Prefer public channels for communication
- Don't forget to say thank you for receiving bug reports
- But also: set clear boundaries and practice saying "NO"
- Be patient



## Companies


## When your business model involves OSS, then you **MUST** invest in OSS

(otherwise your business won't be sustainable)


## Proper planning

- Software has bugs, so does OSS. Account for that beforehand
- Most of the time (always) software need maintenance. Plan and communicate that to your customers
- Have a developer in your team or plan to pay / sponsor one when doing larger / complex projects


## Invest in maintenance

- Sponsor OSS developers on a regular basis
- Sponsor work time
- Encourage your employees to give feedback to the OSS project(s)


## More tips

- Be nice and respectful in communication
- Prefer public channels for communication
- Be graceful with occurring bugs but also have a mitigation strategy
